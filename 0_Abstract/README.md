# M3_WIPER_CONTROL_SYSTEM

## ABSTRACT
```bash
 In this project, A wiper speed control system for an automotive wiper controls and the operational speed of a wiper in
 accordance with rain conditions.The control system includes a sensor (30) detecting rain or water conditions to produce
 the signal using leds. The wiper speed is control by the push button with the delay function. An analog signal having
 an amplitude depending upon the detected rain conditions. The simulation and coding parts are done in "STM32 CUBE-IDE"
 and "CYGWIN TERMINAL". The main of this project is to control the wiper system in the car using the STM32F407vg board. 
 In STM32F407VG, using led's, push button and clock frequency to make the cloning of wiper in simulation mode. It has 
 several mode of operation using the push button to the control the blinking of leds to indicate the wiper control system.
